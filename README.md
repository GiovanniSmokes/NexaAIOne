# What is **NexaAIOne**?
In simple terms, NexaAIOne is a wrapper for OpenAI API that adds multiple essential capabilities, such as Memory, Caching, Document Q&A, and more.


<u>>**Basic**</u> example for using NexaAIOne via API from your application:
```bash
curl https://localhost/api/v1/app/1/1/chatgpt \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN" \
    -d '{
    "cachingPeriod": 60, --> cache AI answer for 60 minutes
    "session": "user-1397", --> Define unique session ID for every user to have different memory & cache management 
    "fakeLLM": 0, --> If you would like to use fakeLLM (during development & testing), or you want this request to be routed to OpenAI
    "enableMemory": "shortMemory", --> Do you want to enable conversation tracking? Turning this on will retain a record of past conversations.
    "memoryOptimization": "summarization", --> Which memory management method you want to use (noOptimization, truncate, or summarization)
    "collection_id": 33, --> Use documents from collection id 33 to answer user question
    "userMessage": "How can I subscribe to your service?" --> send user question to NexaAIOne
}'
```
