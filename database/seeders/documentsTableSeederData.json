The contents are fo r the internal use HRSimplified Online Custo mer s staff and\/or persons as authorised by management.\nGeneral\nSecurity is one of the most important issues affecting the Company \u2019s daily operation. This policy outlines the\nbasis of security maintenance and control, and it is a requirement that the policy be complied with at all times.\nEach employee will be r equired to sign the appropriate acceptance sheet on receipt of his\/her ID access card\nand door key as an acknowledgement of his\/her responsibilities.\n1. Building Access\na. The front door will be locked at all times.\nb. It is anticipated that all access to and fr om the building will be via an access control biometric scanner\nlinked to a security management system. Every employee will be provided with an access code on\nhis\/her first day of engagement. A front -door key will also be issued which is to be used by the last\nperson leaving the building in the evening or weekend.\nc. Access to the building by non -Company personnel will be by invitation only and on the approval of a\ndirector. Under no circumstances will anyone be permitted to walk around the premises\nunac companied.\nd. The last person leaving the building must :\n\u2022 Check that all windows including men\u2019s and ladies\u2019 toilets are securely closed\n\u2022 Switch off all lights with the exception of the outside front door lights\n\u2022 Lower and close all blinds\n\u2022 Ensure the air cond itioning is switched off (except computer room)\n\u2022 Ensure that the computer room door is closed and locked when appropriate\n\u2022 Activate the alarm\n\u2022 Lock the front door (using the key issued)\nShould the last person leaving the building neglect to take the necessar y security precautions (as set out\nabove), and the alarm is activated as a result of his\/her negligence, he\/she will be liable for all resultant\nexpenses incurred.\n2. Alarm System\na. The first member of staff entering, and the last member leaving, the building will be required to\narm or disarm the alarm system by punching in the appropriate code on the keypad next to the\nfront door.\nb. The code, and any changes to it, will be communicated to all staff.\nc. Should the code be incorrectly entered when accessing the bui lding, or the alarm activated at any\ntime whilst the building is occupied, the contracted security company will phone the Company \u2019s\nswitchboard and request the password and the name of a staff member on site. If the incorrect\npassword is given, an armed res ponse unit will be deployed to the building. The password may\nchange from time to time and the new one will be communicated when necessary.\nd. It is incumbent on all staff to make themselves aware of all codes and passwords at all times and\nunder no circumsta nces should these be passed on to anyone other than the Company \u2019s staff.\ne. External contractors will not be allowed to work unattended in the building nor be given any\nsecurity information.\nf. Management will carry out random security checks to verify system fun ctionality and the security\ncompany\u2019s service levels.",

Family responsibility leave\nEvery employee is entitled to 3 days family responsibility leave per annum. Ho wever if an employee needs\nmore than 3 days a year he\/she may apply for this and the directors will consider it on merit. Family\nresponsibility leave covers the following circumstances: -\n\u2022 when an employee\u2019s child is born or\n\u2022 when an employee\u2019s child is sick; or\n\u2022 in the event of the death of :-\no the employee\u2019s spouse, life partner,\no parent, adoptive parent,\no grandparent,\no child, adopted child, grandchild or sibling.\nOn the bottom of the leave form under remarks an employee must write what the purpose is of his\/her family\nleave for example: \u201cbirth of child\u201d. The company may require reasonable proof of an event for which the\nleave was required before granting the leave. The employee may take family responsibility leave in respect\nof the whole or a part of a day. An employee\u2019s unused entitlement to leave in terms of this section lapses at\nthe end of the annual leave cycle in which it accrues.\n5.

As a guide study leave is limited to one paid day for pre -exam study and\none paid day for the actual day the exam is written. If two exams are written on one day, only one paid\nday\u2019s leave is granted. In the event that one exam is written and this is in the morning, and the employee is\nnot writing a further exam the following day, the employee will be expected to return to work immediately\nfollowing the conclusion of that exam. The total number of days study leave granted annually generally\nshould not exceed ten working days. The value of study leave granted shall be subject to and included in\nthe workback obligations in respect of any approved study assistance.\nAny additional time required is to be deducted from the employee\u2019s annual leave entitlement.\nStudy leave for any course unrelated to the position held by the employee, and which does not have\napproval of the employer, will not be granted. In such instances employees will be required to utilise their\nannua l leave entitlement.\nStudy leave will only be approved if the employee\u2019s manager has received a completed leave form with an\nattached exam roster on the specific institution\u2019s letterhead at least 2 weeks before date of leave.\nIf the exam falls on a Mon day study leave will be given for the Monday only. The employee must write\nunder remarks at the bottom of the leave form what the purpose is for study leave, for example: \u201cwriting\nexam\u201d.\nAn employee is not entitled to study leave during his\/her notice pe riod of resignation.\nAlso see Certification Policy AP013.\n6.
