The Sphere at The Venetian Resort, previously referred to as MSG Sphere, is a spherical music and entertainment arena in Paradise, Nevada, United States, near the Las Vegas Strip and east of the Venetian resort designed by Populous. The project was announced by the Madison Square Garden Company in 2018, and was built from 2019 to 2023. The 18,600-seat auditorium[2][3] is being marketed for its immersive video and audio capabilities, which include a 16K resolution wraparound interior LED screen, speakers with beamforming and wave field synthesis technologies, and 4D physical effects. The venue's exterior also features 580,000 sq ft (54,000 m2) of LED displays.

The project was announced in 2018, and construction was underway the following year. Initially scheduled to open in 2021,[2][4] construction was suspended in April 2020 due to a disruption in the project's supply chain caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Construction resumed later that year. The venue measures 366 feet (112 m) high and 516 feet (157 m) wide at its broadest point. It is set to open on September 29, 2023, with U2 performing a 25-show residency called U2:UV Achtung Baby Live at Sphere.[5][6]
History
Background

The project, known then as the MSG Sphere, was announced in February 2018.[7][8] The project was initially a partnership between the Madison Square Garden Company (MSG) and Las Vegas Sands Corporation.[9] The Sphere is just off the Las Vegas Strip and east of the Venetian resort, which was opened by Las Vegas Sands in 1999.[8] Las Vegas Sands contributed the 18-acre (7.3 ha) site for the project.[10] Apollo Global Management purchased the Venetian in 2022 and became MSG's new partner on the Sphere project, replacing Las Vegas Sands.[11] As part of the sale, the land beneath the Venetian and the Sphere was purchased by Vici Properties.[12]

The sphere-shaped project was designed by Populous,[13] and its interior would include the world's largest LED screen.[10] MSG initially estimated the project cost at $1.2 billion.[10] In February 2020, the company said the cost had increased to $1.66 billion as a result of design changes consisting of guest enhancements.[14] The cost continued to increase,[15][16][17] eventually surpassing $2 billion due to the 2021–2023 global supply chain crisis and the 2021–2022 inflation surge.[18][19] With a final expected cost of $2.3 billion,[20] it is the most expensive entertainment venue in Las Vegas history, beating out the $1.9 billion Allegiant Stadium.[12]
Construction

A groundbreaking ceremony was held on September 27, 2018, and was attended by approximately 300 people, including Las Vegas Sands' Sheldon Adelson and Nevada governor Brian Sandoval.[2] In November 2018, it was reported that the MSG Sphere would be built along with new bars, private suites, a museum and retail space.[21] AECOM began working on the site in February 2019, through a preliminary agreement. AECOM had worked on several other stadiums, including the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.[22] Excavation was underway in March 2019.[23] Approximately 110,000 cubic yards (84,000 m3) of dirt and caliche were excavated to prepare the site for construction.[22] AECOM was named as the general contractor in June 2019.[22][24] The project had 400 construction workers. This number was expected to eventually reach a peak of 1,500.[25] Construction of the basement was underway in July 2019.[26]

By October 2019, construction crews had completed the 80,000 sq ft (7,400 m2) basement as well as the first ground level of the sphere.[13] The basement area will be used as public space for events.[25] Excavation went as deep as 21 feet (6.4 m) for construction of the basement.[22] In December 2019, the sphere reached 65 feet (20 m) in height with the completion of a fourth level, out of eight above-ground floors.[27]

In February 2020, the world's fourth-largest crane, a Demag CC-8800 crawler crane, was set up on the site's northeast side for the purpose of lifting heavy construction materials. The crane is capable of standing up to 580 feet (180 m). In a disassembled state, the crane was transported across the Atlantic Ocean from Zeebrugge, Belgium to Port Hueneme, California. The crane then required 120 tractor-trailers to transport it to Las Vegas. A separate crane was required to assemble the main crane, a process which took 18 days.[28][29] In March 2020, construction reached the widest point of the sphere, the 516-foot (157 m) diameter,[25] located at the sixth level and 108 feet (33 m) above ground.[30]

The project had been scheduled to open in 2021.[25] However, MSG announced on March 31, 2020, that construction would be suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The project experienced a disruption in its supply chain, a result of the pandemic, and this hindered construction progress. All construction work on the project was expected to come to a stop over the next two weeks following the announcement.[31][32] In August 2020, MSG Entertainment announced that construction had resumed on the project, with the opening rescheduled for 2023. Over the subsequent 15 months, construction would be focused on concrete, followed by steel erection and then the 13,000-ton steel-domed roof, the most complex part of the project.[33][34] In October 2020, crews completed the heaviest lift up to that point, with the installation of two 240-ton steel girders.[35][36]

MSG took over as general contractor in December 2020, although AECOM continued to provide support.[37][38] A 170-ton steel compression ring was added in February 2021, marking the heaviest lift of the entire project. Due to its size, the ring had to be assembled at the construction site. Work crews spent three weeks welding and bolting the prefabricated steel pieces together, and the crane was then used to lift the ring into place.[39][40][41]
Roof, exosphere, and interior

The dome's roof required 3,000 tons of steel.[42] The roof started to take shape in March 2021, as crews began the installation of 32 trusses, each one weighing 100 tons.[43] Truss installation reached the midway point in May 2021, and the crane had to be moved to the southern side of the property to install the remainder. Because of its size, the crane's relocation took two days.[44]

The dome was topped off on June 18, 2021,[45] and work was already underway on an external exosphere which would be built around the dome.[46] The exosphere will be made of LED light panels which will be visible from several miles away. It will be 30 percent taller than the dome.[45][47] Work on the sphere's interior began in August 2021.[48]

Upon completion of the roof's steel frame, 6,000 cubic yards (4,600 m3) of concrete were then pumped onto the roof. This formed a layer measuring 10 inches (250 mm) in thickness, and weighing approximately 10,000 tons.[49] The roof was finished in October 2021.[49][50] Crews then turned their focus to a 730-ton steel interior frame which will support the LED screens and audio system.[49][51] Work on the interior frame continued into 2022.[11][50]

A second topping out, for the exosphere,[45][47] took place on May 24, 2022.[52][53] This was followed by installation of the interior and exterior LED screens.[53]
Opening

A new name, Sphere at The Venetian Resort, was unveiled in 2023. On July 4, 2023, the Sphere's LED exterior was illuminated during Independence Day celebrations in Las Vegas.[54] The venue is scheduled to open on September 29, 2023, with U2 as its first performer in a residency titled U2:UV Achtung Baby Live at Sphere.[55][56][57] It will mark the group's first live show since 2019.[58] MSG plans on hosting four to six residencies each year at the Sphere.[59] The company is also scheduled to debut a show, Postcards from Earth, at the Sphere in October 2023.[60][61] The venue will employ up to 3,000 people.[62]
